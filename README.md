Maze generator
==============================

This is a python module designed to generate mazes.
It's very slow and mazes could look better, but that's my first try and I wrote it in a very short time.

## Update 2024
After 2 years i finally implemented a decent algorithm (DFS) in the maze generation method. That improved performance (by several orders of magnitude) and thus the maximum maze size that can be generated in an acceptable amount of time.
